When the chaos of the situation overwhelmed the local governments, it was military leadership who looked at their people, the same people this movie mocks, and said make it happen. Within hours, food aid was reaching isolated villages. Within days, airfields were built, cargo aircraft started landing and a food distribution system was up and running. Hours and days, not weeks and months. Yes there are unscrupulous people in the US military. But then, there are in every walk of life, every occupation. But to see people on this website decide that 2.3 million men and women are all criminal, with nothing on their minds but thoughts of destruction or mayhem is an absolute disservice to the things that they do every day. One person on this website even went so far as to say that military members are in it for personal gain. Wow! Entry level personnel make just under $8.00 an hour assuming a 40 hour work week. Of course, many work much more than 40 hours a week and those in harm's way typically put in 16-18 hour days for months on end. That makes the pay well under minimum wage. So much for personal gain. I beg you, please make yourself familiar with the world around you. Go to a nearby base, get a visitor pass and meet some of the men and women you are so quick to disparage. You would be surprised. The military no longer accepts people in lieu of prison time. They require a minimum of a GED and prefer a high school diploma. The middle ranks are expected to get a minimum of undergraduate degrees and the upper ranks are encouraged to get advanced degrees.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","corpus = TEXT\n","tokenized_words = word_tokenize(corpus)\n","\n","# 포터 스테머의 어간 추출\n","def stemming_by_porter(tokenized_words):\n","    porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n","    porter_stemmed_words = []\n","\n","    for word in tokenized_words:\n","        porter_stemmed_words.append(porter_stemmer.stem(word))\n","\n","    return porter_stemmed_words\n","\n","stemming_by_porter(tokenized_words)"],"metadata":{"id":"e4HlCT3wR_6p"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","#nltk.download('punkt')  # needed for acronym such as Mr. Dr. ...\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","\n","#from preprocess import clean_by_freq\n","#from preprocess import clean_by_len\n","#from preprocess import clean_by_stopwords\n","\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/codeitnlp/nlp/imdb.tsv', delimiter='\\\\t')\n","# normalization\n","df['review'] = df['review'].str.lower()  \n","\n","# tokenize\n","df['word_tokens'] = df['review'].apply(word_tokenize)  \n","\n","# cleaning\n","stopwords_set = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","df['cleaned_tokens'] = df['word_tokens'].apply(lambda x: clean_by_freq(x, 1))\n","df['cleaned_tokens'] = df['cleaned_tokens'].apply(lambda x: clean_by_len(x, 2))\n","df['cleaned_tokens'] = df['cleaned_tokens'].apply(lambda x: clean_by_stopwords(x, stopwords_set))\n","\n","# stemming\n","df['stemmed_tokens'] = df['cleaned_tokens'].apply(stemming_by_porter)\n","\n","df['stemmed_tokens'][0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N2zlhyrTUZT8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679307421191,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":296,"user":{"displayName":"M J","userId":"09515631461713927918"}},"outputId":"feb55836-5633-454b-ffb7-ea03b6993b2f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","<ipython-input-11-f673e7f482ef>:13: ParserWarning: Falling back to the 'python' engine because the 'c' engine does not support regex separators (separators > 1 char and different from '\\s+' are interpreted as regex); you can avoid this warning by specifying engine='python'.\n","  df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/codeitnlp/nlp/imdb.tsv', delimiter='\\\\t')\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['one',\n"," 'film',\n"," 'said',\n"," 'realli',\n"," 'bad',\n"," 'movi',\n"," 'like',\n"," 'said',\n"," 'realli',\n"," 'bad',\n"," 'movi',\n"," 'bad',\n"," 'one',\n"," 'film',\n"," 'like']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%load_ext autoreload\n","%autoreload 2"],"metadata":{"id":"iMQXll-xWl23"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# sentence tokenization\n","from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","\n","TEXT = \"\"\"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'\n","So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n","There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!

Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n","In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n","The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n","Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
